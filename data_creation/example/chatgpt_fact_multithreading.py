        "###\nQuestion:What are the frameworks of analysis within which terrorism has been considered (as of 2020)?\nA: Competition between larger nations has resulted in some countries actively supporting terrorist groups to undermine the strength of rival states. Terrorist networks are extended patronage clubs maintained and paid for by their donor states and are conceptualised as being like state actors, to be dealt with using military force.\nB: Globalization has enabled the internationalization of terrorist activities by opening up their operational space, although coordination is still managed from a geographical base. This suggests that terrorist groups are nationally structured which means that terrorism cannot be considered in terms of a war to be defeated militarily without having serious implications on the indigenous population.\nC: Terrorism can be viewed as a problem to be resolved by military means (war on terrorism), by normal police techniques (terrorism as crime), or as a medical problem with underlying causes and symptoms (terrorism as disease).\nD: Terrorism is viewed as a criminal problem. The criminalization of terrorism has two important implications. Firstly, it suggests that terrorism can be eradicated - terrorists can be caught and brought to trial by normal judicial proceedings thereby removing the threat from society - and secondly, it suggests that preventative crime techniques are applicable to prevent its development.\n\n"

Joint injury: Damage to a joint from an injury or trauma can cause changes in the joint that lead to the development of arthritis over time. This is why athletes and people who engage in demanding physical activities are often at an increased risk of developing arthritis in the affected joints.\n\n2.

Over time, this can cause damage to the joint tissue and cartilage, which can increase the likelihood of developing arthritis.\n\n"

AI assistants can also be programmed to perform more complex tasks, such as natural language processing and conversational AI. This allows organizations to interact with customers more effectively and allows them to automate more tasks.\n\n"
