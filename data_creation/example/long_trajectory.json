For a vertical sundial (such as those placed on the walls of buildings, the dial being \"below\" the post), the movement of the sun is from right to top to left, and, accordingly, the shadow moves from left to down to right, i.e., counterclockwise. This effect is caused by the plane of the dial having been rotated through the plane of the motion of the sun and thus\n[2] Diurnal motion\ntwo celestial poles are on the horizon due north and south, and the motion is counterclockwise (i.e. leftward) around Polaris and clockwise (i.e. rightward) around Sigma Octantis. All motion is westward, except for the two fixed points. The daily arc path of an object on the celestial sphere, including the possible part below the horizon, has a length proportional to the cosine of the declination. Thus, the speed of the diurnal motion of a celestial object equals this cosine times 15° per hour, 15 arcminutes per minute, or 15 arcseconds per second.

Similar to sundials with a fixed axial style, a globe dial determines the time from the Sun's azimuthal angle in its apparent rotation about the earth. This angle can be determined by rotating the vane to give the smallest shadow. The simplest sundials do not give the hours, but rather note the exact moment of 12:00 noon.

History of artificial intelligence The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen; as Pamela McCorduck writes, AI began with \"an ancient wish to forge the gods.\" The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who\n[2] Artificial intelligence\ntypes of competencies (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social intelligence), able to be self-conscious and self-aware in interactions with others. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other. These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. \"robotics\" or \"machine learning\"), the use of\n[3] Artificial general intelligence\nmost difficult problems for computers are informally known as \"AI-complete\" or \"AI-hard\", implying that solving them is equivalent to the general aptitude of human intelligence, or strong AI, beyond the capabilities of a purpose-specific algorithm. AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include general computer vision, natural language understanding, and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem. AI-complete problems cannot be solved with current computer technology alone, and also require human computation. This property can be useful to test for the presence of humans, as with CAPTCHAs, and for computer security to repel brute-force attacks.
